== Welcome to the build project

This project helps setup and configure platforms via puppet


== Development, Getting Started
1) Install UBuntu
3) Install git using, sudo apt-get install git-core
4) Add your SSH key to the OS and test it using, ssh -T git@github.com
5) Clone this build project, git clone git@github.com:libster/build.git
6) Edit and make changes as normal

== Testing this project
1) Assuming you have done the above
2) Download and install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and use version 4.1.14
3) Download and install Vagrant from http://vagrantup.com/
4) Vagrant setup steps:
    - cd /path/to/project
    - vagrant up
    - vagrant ssh
    - cd /vagrant
5) Your now inside the VM, install puppet (if this is the first time in the VM) using, sudo apt-get install puppet
6) Execute your build to test using (where file is your puupet script) ./run_puppet [file]
7) You can exit from the VM by typing, exit
8) To stop the vagrant VM type, vagrant halt

* you don't have to exit or halt each time you do a script change, the VM works in tandem with your project folder.

== Vagrant tips
vagrant up
  Starts the VM

vagrant ssh
  Starts an ssh session with the VM, use cd /vagrant to get to your project folder

vagrant status
  Shows the current status of the VM, eg running
 
vagrant box list
  Shows the list of boxes (VM's) available for use with vagrant
 
vagrant destroy
  Destroys the VM, deletes it from VirtualBox's list. Useful if you want to restart with a fresh environment, simply use the vagrant up command to create a new environment (there will be a small wait while VirutalBox recreates the VM)
